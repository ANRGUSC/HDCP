# Heat Diffusion Collection Protocol and Backpressure Control Protocol 
This release contains Contiki based implementation fo the Heat Diffusion Collection Protocol which is a practical optimized version fo the theoretical Heat Diffusion Protocol. This release also contains a contiki implementation of the BCP protocol.

# To Compile
Change the Contiki path to your own contiki path: CONTIKI = /home/pradipta/ANRG/contiki-2.7

Then follow standard contiki instructions for compiling and uploading the code.
This repo also containts two diffeent version of ETX estimations: one using our proposed Gilbert Elliot model based estimation and the the other uses weighted average of etx over time.
